Problem Description and Pipeline

OCR - optical character recognition, from documents
Photo OCR pipeline
- image
- text detection
- character segmentation
- character classification

Sliding Windows
supervised learning for pedestrian detection
aspect ratio of person is always similar, e.g. use 82 x 36 pixels image

scan the image using 82 x 36 pixel and shift (sliding window) by step size / stride parameter

can also scale up the shape, then shrink down to 82 x 36 pixel and match

text detection
- e.g. for text, sliding window across the image to find things that look like text. then expand the found images, to find the 'sentence'

character segmentation
- scan down the text, using split between characters as positive examples, identifying the split and split into separate chars

character classification
- finally classify the standalone text image 

Getting lots of data - artificial data
e.g. for alphabet, generate fonts against random backgrounds
or synthesize data by introducing distortions

discussion on getting more data - how much work to get 10x as much data?

Ceiling analysis : what part of the pipeline to work on next
estimate the errors due to each component (ceiling analysis)
