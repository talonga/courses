Machine Learning by Standard

Link : https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/

This was the first Machine Learning course since university - it is commonly referred to as one of the better courses to get an introduction into Machine Learning.

Pros :
* overview of math for every type of algorithm or technique, really helps in understanding how things work
* good 'university' style of lecture, slides explanations on slides and concepts are built upon gradually
* coding assignents with auto-grading based on test cases

Cons :
* assignments are mainly math driven - implementing the formula and calculations that the ML techniques are based upon
* use of Octave/Matlab seems academic in nature and not applicable for real world application.

<h2>Week 1</h2>

* Supervised / unsupervised learning and model representation
* Minimisation of a cost function such as squared error, using techiques such as gradient descent. Local optima issue
* Linear algebra, scalar and matrix multiplication

<h2>Week 2</h2>

* Multivariate linear regression 
* Feature scaling and learning rate alpha

<h2>Week 3</h2>

* Logistic regression for classification problems
* Sigmoid function and decision boundary
* Advanced optimisation such as BFGS
* Multi-class classification
* Regularisation to help with over-fitting

<h2>Week 4</h2>

* Neural networks for many real-world problems, where there are too many features to do non-linear regression
* Old technique, mimicking neurons in brain

<h2>Week 5</h2>

* Back propagation to refine weights
* Random initialisation of weights

<h2>Week 6</h2>

* Advice for applying machine learning - deciding what to try next 
* Model selection, diagnosing bias and interpreting learning curves

<h2>Week 7</h2>

* Support Vector Machines (SVM) will output prediction instead of probability
* Use of Gaussian kernel - similarity function

<h2>Week 8</h2>

* Unsupervised learning e.g. clustering using K-means
* Optimising the distortion cost function
* Using Principal Component Analysis to reduce dimensionality

<h2>Week 9</h2>

* Anomaly detection, using F1 or precision/recall
* Recommender systems and collaborative filtering

<h2>Week 10</h2>

* Learning with Large Datasets using stochastic or mini-batch adient descent
* Online learning - similar to reinforcement learning

<h2>Week 11</h2>

* Problem description and pipeline e.g. Photo OCR pipeline (image, text detection, character segmentation, character classification)
