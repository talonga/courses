Link : https://www.udemy.com/deeplearning/learn/v4/overview

3rd course on Udemy by the same instructor, first 2 sections are overlapped with Machine Learning A-Z course.

<h2>Part 1 - ANN</h2>

* Using keras.wrappers.scikit_learn.KerasClassifier as a scikit-learn wrapper, to run k-fold cross validation using keras models
* Using keras.layers.Dropout for dropout regularization, to solve overfitting
  * Dropout is a technique which randomly 'drops' several neurons in a particular ANN layer, which makes the network less reliant on specific weights
