Python A-Z : Python For Data Science

Link : https://www.udemy.com/python-coding/

First actual python course I took, after dabbling with Python off and on. Pretty good and short beginner course that touches on multiple aspects of data science applications.

* Jupyter notebooks
* Data structures like dictionaries, lists, tuples
* numpy arrays and slicing
* pandas DataFrame
* Plotting charts using matplotlib and seaborn
