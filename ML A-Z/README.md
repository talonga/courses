Machine Learning A-Z : Hands-on Python and R In Data Science

Link : https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/

Second course I took on Machine Learning - this is a fairly long course that covers many of the common machine learning techniques.

Pros :

* Covers almost all types of Machine Learning
* Python and R code samples for all types, that really shows you how easy most libraries make ML implementation nowadays!
* Instructor explains the intuition behind each type of Machine Learning, such that you understand conceptually how it works. Easier to remember too
* Every chapter has the same consistent style, easy to understand and follow

Cons :

* Some of the intuition explanations are too brief and confusing (e.g. Multi-arm bandit problem ...)
* The coding sections assume near-zero Python knowledge hence a bit too basic and draggy
